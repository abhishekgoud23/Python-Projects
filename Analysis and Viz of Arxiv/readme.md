This Project contains some files which belongs to UMBC and Prof. Ajinkya Borle.

Arxiv is a website that hosts a lot of pre-published research papers.( https://arxiv.org/)
For this project I accessed Arxiv metadata on papers from 2017 to 2021 for certain categories
– AI
– ML
– Computational complexity
– Hardware architecture
Stored in CSV file.

Created a dataframe for each primary category (ML, AI, computational complexity, Hardware architecture), the various fields of the metadata will become columns (title, authors, summary, etc)

For each of the four primary categories considered, drawn a pie chart with slices (%age) for
➢single author papers 
➢two authors papers 
➢3-4 authors papers 
More than four authors.

Made a bar graph. On the X axis, the years. On the Y axis, the number of papers uploaded
• Bars are grouped by category.

Found the top 3 authors in cs.LG (machine learning), cs.AR (hardware architecture) and cs.CC (computation architecture) by number of papers on arxiv (between 2017 and 2021)
➢The criteria is the number of times their name appears as one of the author (i.e can be solo, or with other authors) in the papers.

Found the average publication rate for each of the top 3 authors

Found the mean and median of the number of words in the summary (abstract) for each of the primary categories

Made a histogram for each primary category (ie 4 histograms) with the number of words in summary on the X axis (as bins) and density as Y axis
